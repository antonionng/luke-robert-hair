## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Personal Voice Throughout**
- ❌ **Before:** "Expert cutting and styling designed to last..."
- ✅ **After:** "After 15 years behind the chair, I've learned that every great haircut starts with understanding *you*..."

### 2. **Service Descriptions - Now in First Person**

#### Precision Cut
**Before:** "I will transform your look with cutting-edge technique..."
**After:** "This is my signature service — the one I've refined over 15 years. I'll study how your hair naturally falls, where it wants to move, and create a cut that works with your texture, not against it. You'll leave knowing exactly how to style it at home, and it'll still look sharp 8-10 weeks later."

#### Colour
**Before:** "Colour that captivates and transforms..."
**After:** "Whether you want subtle dimension or a complete transformation, I'll work with you to create colour that enhances your natural beauty. I take the time to understand your lifestyle — how often you can maintain it, what products you use — so your colour works for you, not the other way around."

#### Restyle
**Before:** "Ready for change? Experience a complete transformation..."
**After:** "Ready for a change? This is where we start fresh. I'll spend time understanding what you love (and don't love) about your current style, then craft something that reflects where you are now. It's not just about cutting hair — it's about giving you confidence every time you look in the mirror."

#### Blow Dry
**Before:** "Step out with confidence. I provide professional styling..."
**After:** "Perfect for special occasions or when you just want to feel polished. I'll create smooth, voluminous styling that lasts. And if you want to recreate the look at home, I'll show you exactly how I did it — no secrets, just techniques that actually work."
