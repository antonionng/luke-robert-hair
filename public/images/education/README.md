## Adding New Images

1. **Name your files descriptively**: Use kebab-case naming
   - Good: `cutting-workshop-demo.jpg`, `cpd-training-session.jpg`
   - Avoid: `DSC_9876.jpg`, `temp.jpg`

2. **Place files directly in this folder** (no subfolders)

3. **Test the image**: Images should look professional and align with Luke Robert Hair's premium brand aesthetic

4. **The system will automatically**:
   - Detect new images
   - Add them to the rotation cycle
   - Use them fairly across blog posts

## Current Image Rotation

The system automatically cycles through all images in this folder, ensuring each image gets used before repeating. The least-recently-used image is selected each time a new education-related blog post is created.

## Notes

- Minimum of 3-5 images recommended for variety
- Images should convey professional education and training
- All images should be properly licensed for commercial use
- Maintain consistent quality and brand aesthetic across all images
- Consider including images that show the educational relationship between instructor and students
