## Adding New Images

1. **Name your files descriptively**: Use kebab-case naming
   - Good: `classic-fade-technique.jpg`, `mens-scissor-cut.jpg`
   - Avoid: `IMG_5678.jpg`, `photo.jpg`

2. **Place files directly in this folder** (no subfolders)

3. **Test the image**: Images should look professional and align with Luke Robert Hair's premium brand aesthetic

4. **The system will automatically**:
   - Detect new images
   - Add them to the rotation cycle
   - Use them fairly across blog posts

## Current Image Rotation

The system automatically cycles through all images in this folder, ensuring each image gets used before repeating. The least-recently-used image is selected each time a new barbering-related blog post is created.

## Notes

- Minimum of 3-5 images recommended for variety
- All images should show professional barbering techniques
- All images should be properly licensed for commercial use
- Maintain consistent quality and brand aesthetic across all images
