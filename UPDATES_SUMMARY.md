## ✍️ Education Page - Now Personal!

### Hero Section (Luke's Voice)
**Before:** "Education isn't about theory..."  
**After:** "After 15 years behind the chair and training hundreds of stylists, I have learned what actually works. Not theory. Not trends. Just proven techniques that you can use on Monday morning with real clients."

### Why I Teach Section
**Before:** "With years of experience training stylists..."  
**After:** "I remember the fear of standing behind the chair early in my career. That moment when you are not quite sure if you can deliver what the client wants. I have been there. Now, as a L'Oréal Professional Ambassador, I help stylists move past that fear and into true confidence..."

### Courses Section
**Before:** "Choose the course that matches your skill level..."  
**After:** "Whether you are just starting out or looking to refine your advanced skills, I have built these courses to meet you where you are and take you where you want to be."
