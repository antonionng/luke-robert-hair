## 🎯 TO-DO: 4 Things You Need to Do

### 1️⃣ SET YOUR SITE URL (2 minutes)

**Important for blog post SEO!**

Create a file called `.env.local` in your project root and add:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://lukeroberthair.com
```

Replace with your actual domain. For local testing, use:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

This ensures individual blog posts generate proper share URLs.

                   ✓ Cheshire & Berkshire"
