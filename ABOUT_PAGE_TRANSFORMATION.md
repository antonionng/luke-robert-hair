## ✨ **What Changed - Before & After**

### **Hero Section**

**BEFORE:**
> "Beautiful, Wearable Hair — Built on Education"
> 
> "I'm Luke Robert, a hairdresser and educator based in Cheshire and Oxford..."

**AFTER:**
> "From Scared Apprentice to L'Oréal Educator"
> 
> "I still remember my first solo client. My hands were shaking. I second-guessed every section, every angle. Would she hate it? Would I ruin her hair?
> 
> That fear drove me to obsess over technique. I practiced until 2am...
> 
> 15 years later, I do not shake anymore. But I remember that feeling. And it is why I teach the way I do."

**Impact:** Vulnerable, relatable, hooks the reader emotionally
